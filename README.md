# C Project Template

![cover](img/cpt-cover.png)

Every C project has a lazy start by creating lots of command line parsers, Makefiles, help and usage messages. **C Project Template** aims to take you to the solution point! The point you write the code that solves your problem.

The project brings you a Makefile, command line options parsing, colors for pretty printing, [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) report, and unittest
using [cmocka](https://cmocka.org/). 

## Usage
* Clone project
* Edit `project.conf`
